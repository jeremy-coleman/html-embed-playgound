  <!-- 
    If you delete the head scripts, Button doesnt render . network tab shows cache hit, but still ~30ms load time per embed
    and multiple copies are loaded into memory. 
    peer embed <-> peer embed resources dont seem to be sharable
    parent -> child embed resources don't seem to be sharable (ofc can use some shared storage mechanism)
    
    check if sharable resources can be cloned over message channel or broadcast channel
    check if a ref to a cloned fetch can be sharable
    check *LATENCY* not execution time of idb and local storage
    we're on the same origin, so this shouldn't be a permission issue
    
    sidenote: an embed's purpose isnt sandboxing, but that's what its doing. - its purpose is to host non-native apps, which of course should be trusted
